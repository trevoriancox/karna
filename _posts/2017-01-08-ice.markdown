As I sat indoors looking a the beautiful, sunny day outside, I thought it was funny that 5 cm of snow led to a 
[State of Emergency](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/weather/article124918289.html)
in North Carolina. However, when I actually went outside to walk to the grocery store, every
step was a hazard as the city had turned into a skating rink.

Fortunately, my host (a Northerner with Canadian parents) just happened to have
a pair of Yaktrax she could lend me, and I was subsequently able to safely commute downtown
on foot every day while the ice lasted.

On my way to work on Monday, I passed abandoned vehicles in the street (and almost in the ditch),

and had to watch out for powerlines...
