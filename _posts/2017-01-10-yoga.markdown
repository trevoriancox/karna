All the same trends are in evidence here in Durham, as in New York or Vancouver.

Laketa would love this studio: natural light, old wood, exposed brick, candles... and even a grand piano!

Just a few doors down from the office, and only $20 for 10 days (intro) or $10 drop-in for American Underground tenants, so I'm all set to stay in shape.

After an easy first yoga session today, I definitely wasn't feeling a desire for a chicken and waffles lunch again.
